Open the index.html file in a web browser (you can do this by double-clicking on the file or dragging it into your browser).
Start Logging Challenges:

In the input field, enter the challenge you worked on today, then click "Log Challenge".
The challenge will appear in the list below the form.
Feedback:

Based on the number of challenges logged, you will receive motivational feedback. For example:
After 10 challenges: "Good start! Keep up the momentum!"
After 50 challenges: "Great job! You're making solid progress."
Persistence:

Your progress will be saved locally in your browser. So, even if you refresh the page, your challenges and feedback will remain until you clear the browserâ€™s local storage.
Next Steps
This is a very basic version of the 90-day tracker. You can add further features and enhancements like:

Tracking specific goals or tasks (e.g., completing specific tutorials).
UI enhancements (such as showing a progress bar for 90 days).
Improved feedback (more personalized and detailed feedback, perhaps using AI-like logic).
Advanced data persistence (with a backend or syncing across devices).
This simple sample should be a great starting point for your 90-day journey of building and refining a programming progress tracker!
